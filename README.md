# The Problem
#### COVID-19 has caused youths to be behind screens for safety. However, the lessons are still ineffective due to the same traditional ineffective teaching method of inserting information rather than triggering information.

#### At the same time, students require one-on-one tuitioning with teachers and peers, which pose a risk of infection.

# Our product makes traditional online tutoring more interesting, by connecting tutors and tutees 1 on 1 in virtual classrooms and providing them with interactive learning tools. This is not only safe and effective, solving 2 problems at once, but also makes their time more exciting with interactive tools.
